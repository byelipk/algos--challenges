/**
I'm making a search engine called MillionGazillionâ„¢.

I wrote a crawler that visits web pages, stores a few keywords in a
database, and follows links to other web pages. I noticed that my
crawler was wasting a lot of time visiting the same pages over and
over, so I made a set, visited, where I'm storing URLs I've already
visited. Now the crawler only visits a URL if it hasn't already been visited.

Thing is, the crawler is running on my old desktop computer in my parents'
basement (where I totally don't live anymore), and it keeps running out of
memory because visited is getting so huge.

How can I trim down the amount of space taken up by visited?
