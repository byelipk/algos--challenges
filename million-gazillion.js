/**
I'm making a search engine called MillionGazillionâ„¢.

I wrote a crawler that visits web pages, stores a few keywords in a
database, and follows links to other web pages. I noticed that my
crawler was wasting a lot of time visiting the same pages over and
over, so I made a set, visited, where I'm storing URLs I've already
visited. Now the crawler only visits a URL if it hasn't already been visited.

Thing is, the crawler is running on my old desktop computer in my parents'
basement (where I totally don't live anymore), and it keeps running out of
memory because visited is getting so huge.

How can I trim down the amount of space taken up by visited?

  // So, how many characters are stored in our trie?
  //
  // Assume we can only store 26 chars in the trie [a-zA-Z].
  // Let's also assume we limit the length of the string to 5 characters.
  // That means the first character has 26 possibilities. The second
  // character also has 26 possibilities, but it also has 26 children
  // posibilities, or 26^2 child nodes. And so on...
  //
  // To store store all 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 character URLs, the trie
  // will have 5 layers, making the total number of nodes:
  //
  //  26^5 + 26^4 + 26^3 + 26^2 + 26^1
  //
  // That means for all URLs of length n or fewer the total number
  // of nodes is: 26^n + (26^n-1 ...) + 26^1
  //
  // The big o of this is O(26 n)
